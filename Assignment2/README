Compiling and Running:
1) Call the make command
2) run ./proxy <port number>

(
if this doesnt work, it can be manually compiled by:
gcc proxy.c csapp.c -o proxy -pthread
)

A few issues with the code:
In theory what I wrote is correct, but there is something wrong in my code
where it is only showing about half of the web page and only in the basic 
html.
The site www.gnu.org is not working for me since it does not give me a get request.
